## Features

- Follow ðŸŽ¨ system color mode, or choose between ðŸŒƒ dark mode and ðŸ”† light mode.
- Update `youtube-dl`/`yt-dlp` on startup.
- List all available formats.
- Override video, audio formats and output container.
- Embed metadata into downloaded file.
- Download and embed thumbnails and subtitles.
- Download playlists.
- Specify custom download path.
- Specify custom `ffmpeg` path.
- Specify custom proxy.

## Usage

1. Download the pre-built binary or build it from source.
2. Download [`youtube-dl`](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) or [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) from the upstream. _Optionally but recommended_, get `ffmpeg` either by [building from source](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) or downloading [pre-built binaries](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/) for Windows.
3. The framework-dependent binary requires an installed [.NET 5 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) to run. Alternatively, download the self-contained binary that bundles the runtime. The upstream `youtube-dl` binary requires MSVC++ 2010 x86 runtime.
4. Run `youtube-dl-wpf.exe`. Go to __Settings__. Set the path to `youtube-dl`/`yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`.
5. Go back to the home tab. Paste a video URL and start downloading! ðŸš€

## FAQ

1.  Q: The __Download__ button is grayed out and I can't click it!

    A: `youtube-dl-wpf` is a simple GUI wrapper. It doesn't bundle any downloader with it. You have to download `youtube-dl`/`yt-dlp` from the upstream. The `ffmpeg` binary is required by `youtube-dl`/`yt-dlp` when downloading and merging separate video and audio tracks, which is the case for any video resolution higher than 360p on YouTube.

2.  Q: How can I use a proxy to download?

    A: Leave the proxy field empty to use system proxy settings. Otherwise the format is similar to how `curl` accepts proxy strings. Examples are, `socks5://localhost:1080/`, `http://localhost:8080/`. Currently the upstream doesn't accept `socks5h` protocol and treat `socks5` as `socks5h` by always resolving the hostname using the proxy. This is tracked in [this issue](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/22618).

3.  Q: Downloading the whole playlist doesn't work!

    A: It's an upstream bug, just like many other issues you might discover. There's nothing I can do. Just report the bug to the [upstream](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl).

4.  Q: `youtube-dl` and `yt-dlp` behave differently!

    A: In some cases, yes, and `youtube-dl-wpf` tries to align their behavior by sending different options and arguments for different backends. See the [backends documentation](Backends.md) for more information.

## To-Do

- [ ] v2.0 - The Parallel Update: download management and download queue for parallel downloads.

## Build

Prerequisites: .NET 5 SDK

Note for packagers: The application by default uses executable directory as config directory. To use user's config directory, define the constant `PACKAGED` when building.

```bash
# Build with Release configuration
$ dotnet build -c Release

# Publish as framework-dependent
$ dotnet publish YoutubeDl.Wpf -c Release

# Publish as self-contained for Windows x64
$ dotnet publish YoutubeDl.Wpf -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained

# Publish as self-contained for packaging on Windows x64
$ dotnet publish YoutubeDl.Wpf -c Release -p:DefineConstants=PACKAGED -r win-x64 --self-contained
```
