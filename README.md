## Features

- Toggle between ðŸŽ¨ system color mode, ðŸŒƒ dark mode, and ðŸ”† light mode.
- Update `youtube-dl` on startup.
- List available formats.
- Override video and audio formats.
- Toggle metadata embedding.
- Toggle thumbnail and subtitles embedding.
- Toggle downloading a single video or the whole playlist.
- Custom download path.
- Custom `ffmpeg` and `youtube-dl` path.
- Custom proxy support.

## Usage

1. Download the pre-built binary or build it from source.
2. Download [`youtube-dl`](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) from the upstream. _Optionally but recommended_, get `ffmpeg` either by [building from source](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) or downloading [pre-built binaries](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/) for Windows.
3. Make sure you have [.NET Core 3.1 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/current/runtime) installed to run our app. The upstream `youtube-dl` binary requires [MSVC++ 2010 runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13523).
4. Run `youtube-dl-wpf.exe`. Open the left drawer and go to __Settings__. Set the path to `youtube-dl` and `ffmpeg`.
5. Go back to the home tab. Paste a URL and start downloading! ðŸš€

## F.A.Q.

- _Q:_ The __Download__ button is grayed out and I can't click it!
- _A:_ `youtube-dl-wpf` is a simple GUI wrapper. It doesn't embed any downloader in it. You have to download `youtube-dl` from the upstream. The `ffmpeg` binary is required by `youtube-dl` when downloading and merging separate video and audio tracks, which is the case for any video resolution higher than 360p.

- _Q:_ Why can't I specify custom container and custom format at the same time?
- _A:_ Currently `youtube-dl`'s format matching algorithm doesn't handle this very well. And I don't want to see workarounds for it in my code. So it is blocked intentionally to prevent issues.

- _Q:_ How can I use a proxy to download?
- _A:_ Leave the proxy field empty to use system proxy settings. Otherwise the format is similar to how `curl` accepts proxy strings. Examples are, `socks5://localhost:1080/`, `http://localhost:8080/`. Currently the upstream doesn't accept `socks5h` protocol and treat `socks5` as `socks5h` by always resolving the hostname using the proxy. This is tracked in [this issue](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/22618).

- _Q:_ Downloading the whole playlist doesn't work!
- _A:_ It's an upstream bug, just like many other issues you might discover. There's nothing I can do. Just report the bug to the [upstream](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl).
